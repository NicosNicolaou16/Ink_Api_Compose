# Ink API Compose

This open source project is testing the new Google Ink API with an example for drawer with options
to select colors and erase the drawing.

# Small History Behind this Repository

I began this project to test the new Google Ink API, and while I was working on it, my son saw it
and asked if he could draw. I told him to wait, then quickly implemented a simple version with
options to select colors and erase the drawing. After generating the APKs (my daughter also saw it),
I installed the app on their tablet, and they started drawing right away.
