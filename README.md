## A Brief History Behind This Repository :smiley:

I began this project to test the new Google Ink API, and while I was working on it, my son saw it
and asked if he could draw. I told him to wait, then quickly implemented a simple version with
options to select colors and erase the drawing. After generating the APKs (my daughter also saw it),
I installed the app on their tablet, and they started drawing right away.

## Hereâ€™s a list of features to highlight for the app

- Color Selection: Allows users to choose from a variety of colors for drawing.
- Erase Tool: Provides the option to erase any part of the drawing.
- Tablet Compatibility: Works seamlessly on tablets for an enhanced drawing experience.
- Convert the stroke to a bitmap and display it in a dialog.
